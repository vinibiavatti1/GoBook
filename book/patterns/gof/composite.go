// Composite
// Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures to
// represent part-whole hierarchies.
// Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
// In other words, it allows you to create a tree structure where each node can be either a leaf or a composite.

// The interface defines the common operations for both leaf and composite objects.

// The composite contains a collection of leaf and composite objects.
// It implements the same interface as the leaf struct.
// It delegates the operations to its children.

// The leaf struct implements the same interface as the composite struct.
