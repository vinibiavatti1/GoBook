// Generate
// The generate directive is used to automate code generation during development.
// It is a special comment that can be placed in Go source files.
// The directive is followed by a command that will be executed to generate the code.
// The command can be any executable that can be run from the command line, such as a shell script or a Go program.
// To run the generation, execute: "go generate".  This will scan the file for all //go:generate directives and execute them.
// Syntax:
//   //go:generate <command>

package directives

// Directive
// The following command will generate the resources/generated.txt file.
// Note that any command can be used, including shell commands or Go programs.
// It is usually used by the stringer tool to generate code for stringer interfaces.
//
//go:generate cmd /C "echo This file was generated! > resources/generated.txt"

// Generate Command
// Now, to process the directive, we can use the go generate command in the terminal.
// This will execute the command specified in the directive and generate the resources/generated.txt file.
var _ = `
go generate        // Run generate commands in the current directory.
go generate ./...  // Recursively generate all packages in the current directory and its subdirectories.
