// Structure
// Go projects follow a specific structure to ensure clarity and maintainability.
// This structure is particularly important for larger projects, where organization can significantly
// impact development speed and ease of understanding.

package project

// Project Structure
var _ = `
project
|- /cmd      // Main files (main.go) for this project.
|- /internal // Private application and library code.
|- /pkg      // Public libraries for other projects.
|- go.mod 	 // Module definition and dependencies.
`

// Cmd Directory
// The cmd directory contains the main files for the project.
// Each subdirectory within cmd typically corresponds to a different executable program.
// This was defined as a convention in the Go community to help organize code.

// Internal Directory
// The internal is a special directory in Go projects that is used to define private code.
// Code in this directory is not accessible to other projects, even if they import the module. This is useful for
// encapsulating implementation details and ensuring that only the intended code is exposed to other packages.

// Pkg Directory
// The pkg directory is used for public libraries that can be imported by other projects.
// Code in this directory is intended to be reusable and can be shared across different projects.
