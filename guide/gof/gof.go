// Gang of Four (GoF)
// The Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns are a set of 23 software design patterns that were introduced in the book
// "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software".
// These patterns provide solutions to common software design problems and are widely used in object-oriented programming.
// While Go is not strictly object-oriented, many of these patterns can still be applied in Go's idiomatic way.
// The patterns are divided into three categories: creational, structural, and behavioral.
