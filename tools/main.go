// Tools
// Go provides a variety of tools that enhance the development experience by automating repetitive tasks,
// generating boilerplate code, and improving code quality.
// These tools can be installed using the "go install" command and are typically placed in the "GOPATH/bin" directory,
// making them accessible from the command line.
// A common example is the "stringer" tool, which automatically generates the String() method for custom types
// based on their constants. This is especially useful when working with enums or logging.

package main

// Installing Tools
// To install a tool, use the "go install" command followed by the package path.
// For example:
var _ = `
go install <module-path>
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer@latest
`

// Uninstalling Tools
// To uninstall a tool, simply remove the binary from the "GOPATH/bin" directory or use the "go clean -i" command.
// For example:
var _ = `
go clean -i <module-path>
go clean -i golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer
`
